;;;; json.lisp --- Zero-dependency pure-SBCL JSON parser/encoder.
;;;;
;;;; Adapted from the repository json template: package renamed to
;;;; PAM-AUDIT.JSON; no behavioural changes to the parser or encoder.
;;;;
;;;; Uses only COMMON-LISP + UIOP (for parse-file).
;;;; No Quicklisp dependencies. `sbcl --script build.lisp` works standalone.
;;;;
;;;; Value model (shared with pam-audit.util):
;;;;   object -> hash-table (test 'equal), array -> vector,
;;;;   true -> T, false -> :FALSE, null -> NIL.
;;;;   Empty array decodes to #() (never NIL) so [] and null stay distinct.
